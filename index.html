            <h5 class="card-title">Hobbies</h5>
            <p class="card-text">One of my favorite hobbies is reading—there’s nothing like getting lost in a good book. Since the start of the year, I’ve read seven books and I’m aiming to reach a goal of 24 by the end of the year. I enjoy a variety of genres, especially stories that explore complex themes, rich worldbuilding, or philosophical questions. A few of my favorite reads so far this year include <em>Empire of Gold</em> by S.A. Chakraborty, a sweeping fantasy steeped in Middle Eastern folklore; <em>James</em> by Percival Everett, a powerful reimagining of <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> through the lens of race and agency; and <em>Babel</em> by R.F. Kuang, a dark academic fantasy that examines language, colonialism, and rebellion.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Outside of reading, I love spending time with my cat, Radish, who brings a lot of personality and joy into my everyday routine. I also enjoy playing video games—especially narrative-driven or cozy games—and going on walks to unwind and clear my head. Lately, I’ve been training to start running again. I really miss it and want to build back the habit, both because it makes me feel good and because I’m working toward a healthier, more active lifestyle.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Interests</h5>
            <p class="card-text">I’m a big fan of <em>Last of Us</em> franchise—not just the TV adaptation, but the entire world and story that started with the games. I’m currently watching Season 2 and loving every moment. One of my favorite things about the series is how it stays loyal to the original story while flawlessly expanding on the background characters and their emotional journeys. It’s rare to see a franchise handle adaptation with so much care and depth, and it’s something I really admire</p>
            <p class="card-text">I’m also a huge Formula 1 fan—this is my second season watching, and I’ve become completely hooked. My favorite driver is Oscar Piastri, who drives for McLaren, currently the team with the fastest car on the grid. I truly believe he’s the next World Champion—mark my words! I love the mix of strategy, speed, and precision that goes into each race, and every race weekend is something I genuinely look forward to.</p>
